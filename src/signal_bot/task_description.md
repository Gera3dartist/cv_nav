# Task 3: Signal Bot with ATAK Integration 

## Objective: Create a Signal bot to send geolocation and target information to an ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit) client. 

## Steps: 
1.  Design a Python-based Signal bot that can send messages like:  "48.567123 39.87897 tank" (longitude, latitude, target description). 2.  Format the message in Cursor on Target (CoT) protocol. 
3.  Send the formatted CoT message to an ATAK client (https://www.civtak.org/). 
4.  Ensure that the message is displayed in the ATAK client interface. 

## Deliverables: 
- Python script for the Signal bot. 
- Documentation on how to set up and run the bot, as well as a description of the CoT protocol formatting. 
- Confirmation or demonstration that the messages display correctly in ATAK.
