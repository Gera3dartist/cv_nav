# Task 2: Drone Path Prediction

## Objective: Using a video file (video1), extract coordinates and construct a drone’s flight path on a map.

## Steps:
- Apply an Optical Flow algorithm (using OpenCV or any other library) to the video to track the motion of points.
- Based on the motion data, predict the drone’s path.
- Plot the path on a map for visualization.
- (Optional) Implement the task using alternative motion estimation algorithms for comparison (e.g., Deep Learning approaches).

## Deliverables:
- Code to process the video and predict the drone’s path.
- A map visualization showing the predicted path.
- Documentation explaining the approach, tools used, and results.
